# media_subpath: '/posts/20180809' [media_subpath: /img/path/ When a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the media resources. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post. And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png). The output will be:<img src="/img/path/flower.png" alt="The flower" />

## My Second Photoshoot: Learning, Experimenting, and Loving the Process

Hey there! I’m just getting started with photography, and this was my second-ever shoot. I was on a short getaway with my girlfriend early january, and she was kind enough to model for me. We were staying in this beautiful little hotel in Bronkhorst—the smallest city in the Netherlands (seriously, look it up!).

The room had this warm, cozy vibe—perfect for an intimate shoot.

  We started close to the bed, playing with soft lighting and relaxed poses. I loved how the light shaped the scene, making everything feel effortlessly beautiful. She stretched out...

  After a while, we switched things up and moved to the floor. This instantly changed the mood—more contrast, more drama. I experimented with angles, getting low to add depth and perspective. It’s crazy how just a small change in position can transform an image!

What I learned from this shoot? Comfort and creativity go hand in hand. When the model feels at ease, the photos reflect that. And when you’re willing to move around, try different angles, and play with light, you discover new ways to tell a story.

If you’re a beginner like me, here’s my advice: just go for it. Every shoot is a chance to grow, experiment, and have fun. Looking back at these shots, I can see how much I’ve already learned—and I can’t wait for the next one!
